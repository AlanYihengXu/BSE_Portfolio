# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to get some games onto the Raspberry Pi and having them run. First, I needed to download an Imager to install an OS onto the Raspberry Pi. After plugging the SD card into my computer, I imaged the RetroPie OS onto the SD card before ejecting the card and plugging it into the Raspberry Pi. With the OS now installed, I went through setting up and configuring RetroPie. Afterwards, I downloaded ROMs of some games onto a USB drive, plugged that into the Raspberry Pi to upload them, and rebooted the system when the uploading finished. Lastly, I used a scraper to scrape game data from the internet so that there would be information on each of the games, and not just file names.
