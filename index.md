# Video Game Emulator with Raspberry Pi
This will serve as a brief description of your project. Limit this to three sentences because it can become overly long at that point. This copy should draw the user in and make she/him want to read more.

# Final Milestone
  

My final milestone was...

# Second Milestone
  

My second milestone was creating a custom theme on my RetroPie. I created xml files as the main way to code the theme, and used html tags such as <pos> and <size> so adjust where I wanted each element of the theme. After I finished the custom theme, I ran into a problem trying figuring out how to move the theme's files from my computer onto the Raspberry Pi. The solution was to create a repository on github and to use git commit and git push on my computer's terminal to move the files into the repository. Then, I used git clone on the Raspberry Pi's terminal to clone the repository onto it cp to move the files into the right folder. Finally I changed my RetroPie's theme to the custom one by going into the UI settings and setting the theme.

# First Milestone
  

My first milestone was to get some games onto the Raspberry Pi and having them run. First, I needed to download an Imager to install an OS onto the Raspberry Pi. After plugging the SD card into my computer, I imaged the RetroPie OS onto the SD card before ejecting the card and plugging it into the Raspberry Pi. With the OS now installed, I went through setting up and configuring RetroPie. Afterwards, I downloaded ROMs of some games onto a USB drive, plugged that into the Raspberry Pi to upload them, and rebooted the system when the uploading finished. Lastly, I used a scraper to scrape game data from the internet so that there would be information on each of the games, and not just file names.
